run Demo
1.import the AnOrxDemo from /path/to/orx/code/demo/android in eclipse project
2.run the demo in eclipse
note that you can also do it in terminal (meanwhile by ant). Besides, You had better rebuild it by ndk

recompile the demo and lib
go to /path/to/orx/code/demo/android to ndk-build to recompile the demo, while to recompile the lib,
go to /path/to/orx/code/build/android. 
and for lib you have to copy the liborx*.a into /path/to/orx/lib/android optionally
(I don't know how to move it in *.mk automatically).

the debug mode
1.use ndk-build ORX_DEBUG=true -B to rebuild the whole lib or the demo in debug mode.
2.change isDebug=true in the android activity.

###IMPORTANT###
-B means recompile the whole lib, every source will be recompile by ndk
when change from one mode to another mode, -B is essential. Otherwise, some file may not be recompiled in current mode.
